# Reflective Essay

As a student who are taking a course in technical writing, I found the peer review process to be an invaluable component of my learning process. Through reviewing my peers' work and receiving feedback on my own (I still want to see feedback on my works ðŸ¥²), I gained insights into the principles of technical communication and honed my skills in providing constructive criticism. This reflective essay aims to explore my experiences with peer review and the evolution of my reviewing skills throughout the course.

While I understood the importance of receiving feedback to improve my writing, I was uncertain about my ability to provide meaningful critiques to others. However, as I engaged in the process and participated in peer review sessions, I developed my reviewing skills.

One of the most significant lessons I learned from the peer review process was importance of clarity and conciseness in technical communication. As I reviewed my peers' work, I became more aware to the need for clear and straightforward language, as well as the avoidance of unnecessary verbosity. This realization not only improved my ability to provide feedback but also enhanced my own writing skills as I applied these principles to my work.

Moreover, the peer review process helped me understand the importance of coherence and audience analysis in technical writing. Through critiquing my peers' documents, I learned to evaluate the logical flow of information and consider the needs of intended audience. This awareness enabled me to provide targeted feedback aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of communication.

Additionally, participating in peer review allowed me to refine my document design skills. While reviewing my peers' work, I paid attention to formatting elements such as headings, lists and visual aids, which contributed to readability and accessibility of documents. This experience deepened my understanding of the role of document design in enhancing effectiveness of technical communication.

Furthermore, peer review process provided me with opportunities to develop my ability to identify key points and provide constructive feedback. By critically analyzing my peers' documents, I learned to identify strengths and weaknesses, articulate my observations and suggest actionable recommendations for improvement. This skill proved invaluable not only in peer review sessions but also in revising my own work based on feedback from others (feedback that was not shown to us ðŸ¤©).

In conclusion, peer review has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of technical communication and refining my reviewing skills. Through actively engaging with my peers' work, I gained insights into the principles of clarity, conciseness, coherence, audience analysis, and document design. Moreover, I developed the ability to identify key points and provide constructive feedback aimed at improving overall effectiveness of technical communication. As I continue to apply these skills in my future works, I am confident that the lessons learned from the peer reviews will continue to guide me in my journey as a technical writer.

This essay reflects on my experiences with peer reviews and evolution of my reviewing skills throughout the course. Through critiquing my peers' work, I gained insights into the principles of technical communication and polished my ability to provide constructive feedback. Overall, peer reviews have played an important role in shaping my understanding of technical writing and improving my skills in this area.

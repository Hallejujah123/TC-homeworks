# Personal Safety Rules

Do not share your passwords, PINs, CVV codes, and SMS codes with anyone, including employees of trusted organizations.

Do not click on suspicious links. Scammers may send you a link to a fake website to steal your account logins and passwords or your banking card information.

Use only official Ozon Seller applications in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/ozon-seller/id1501167158?utm_source=sellers&utm_medium=comms&utm_campaign=global) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.ozon.seller_app&utm_source=sellers&utm_medium=comms&utm_campaign=global).

## How to Protect Your Account from Hacking

### Check Website Addresses

Always check if the website address you are on matches the official Ozon Seller address: [seller.ozon.com](https://seller.ozon.com/).
If the Ozon page seems suspicious to you, do not enter your personal information on it. Close the page if your browser displays a message about redirecting to a suspicious site.

### Install Antivirus Software

Make sure your device is free from viruses. With viruses, attackers can steal your files, lock your computer, and obtain passwords for the websites you are registered on.
Free programs [Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool](http://support.kaspersky.ru/viruses/kvrt2020) or [Dr.Web CureIt!](http://free.drweb.ru/cureit/) can help quickly check your computer and remove viruses. You need to download them again before checking. To protect your computer permanently, you need to install antivirus software.
Free antiviruses: [Avira](https://www.avira.com/ru), [Kaspersky Free](http://www.kaspersky.ru/free-antivirus).

### Connect Mobile Data Authorization

If a password can be hacked or guessed, and an access code can be intercepted, then it is impossible to forge biometric data. In addition, this method is faster, you will not have to wait for a code in an SMS.

### Set Up Phone Lock

Do not leave your phone unattended and always lock it. Set up a password or biometric lock. A PIN or pattern is less secure than no lock at all, but better than no lock at all.
Find information about encryption methods on your device and choose the appropriate one. This can help in case of loss, as your data will be safe.
Put a PIN on your SIM card, as most accounts are tied to your phone number. If an attacker gains access to your phone, even if it is locked or encrypted, the card can be inserted into another phone.
Be careful when installing applications, even from official stores. When installing, check what permissions the application requires, and deny suspicious ones, such as access to SMS.
Other recommendations:
• If you lose your phone, contact Ozon and ask to temporarily block your account. Then block your SIM card with your mobile operator.
• If you change your mobile phone number, turn off notifications in your account. If the SIM card stops working, call your mobile operator and find out the reason. Perhaps scammers are attacking you.
• Do not enable notifications on other people's phones, even if people claiming to be Ozon employees ask you to.

### Limit the Use of Public Networks

We do not recommend using public Wi-Fi networks to log in to your account or make purchases — there are risks of data leakage, as the network and its encryption may be configured by an attacker.

### Update Software

Do not ignore update notifications. Always use the latest versions of applications, as updates often contain not only new features, but also security improvements.

## How to Safely Use Your Ozon Seller Account

• Do not share login passwords with anyone, not even your close ones or Ozon employees.
• Use only the official Ozon Seller website: [seller.ozon.com](https://seller.ozon.com/). Save it to your browser bookmarks.
